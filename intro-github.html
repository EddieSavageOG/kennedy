      <h1>Welcome to Github, Kennedy!</h1>
      <h2>Be kind on this webpage design, I'm whipping it up really quick, okay? :P</h2>

      <h3>So, what is github?</h3>

      <p>In broad strokes, github is a subsidiary of Microsoft and is a cloud-based platform for storing, sharing, and managing code using Git.</p>

      <h3>What the heck is Git then!?</h3>

      <p>Once again, in broad strokes, Git is a distributed version control system typically used for coordinating coding work among programmers/developers. It stores code in "repositories" that have individual "branches" that can be "forked" (split into two branches) or "merged" (two branches merged together into one branch) in such a way that individual changes can be tracked and preserved. This is usually referred to as "version control" or "source control." It gets a lot more complicated than that, but suffice to say that this allows people to go back after changes were made to code and files and retrieve pre-altered code or to roll back entire changes to their previous state which can be extremely valuable and save a LOT of development time.</p>

      <p>You can download git from <a href = "https://git-scm.com/">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Using Git</h3>

      <p>There's a proper tutorial <a href="https://githowto.com/setup">here</a> and I definitely recommend going through it.</p>

      <p>I'll be honest, I only learned about Git last year so I'm still getting the hang of it. I still have a post it note on my monitor that has my preferred git flow written on it and I'll share that flow with you.</p>

      <p>It goes:</p>

      <ol>
            <li>git add . </li>
            <li>git status</li>
            <li>git commit -m "[comment]"</li>
            <li>git push</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The explanation of those steps goes like:</p>

      <ol>
            <li>This command adds every changed file to the queue</li>
            <li>This command shows me the status of my queue - I like to verify that what I expect to see in there is actually in there</li>
            <li>This is how I add a comment to my commit - a little note to myself about what I did and what I still need to do</li>
            <li>This commits my changes to my repository</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>This concludes our brief overview of Git. This document is on github, so from here, you can explore this repo itself to see what I'm talking about. Let me know what questions you have because this is absolutely NOT a complete explanation!</h2>
