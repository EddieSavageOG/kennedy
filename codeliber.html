            <h1>Codeliber Feedback</h1>

            <h2>This is quick and messy</h2>

            <h2>Codeliber notes:</h2>

            <p>When recreating websites we are developing two important skill categories: </p>

<ol>
      <li>On our development skills! This is our ability to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as any other necessary technologies like SQL, React, Python, PHP, etc. that a project may utilize to achieve it's functionality</li>
      <li>On our attention to detail! In the process of development, we cannot create a site if we cannot properly perceive or  understannd what we are supposed to be creating. This is a skill and NOT a natural ability, and, as such, it is only normal that we start out bad at it and have to work and practice at it to get better. It is important to understand that at the outset. Similar to learning a new language and recognizing that not every language shares the same sound formations as other languags and so it may be necessary to learn how to perceive entire new sounds that one never learned to notice or perceive before, so, too, do we need to learn to perceive, notice, and recreate visual items that we may previously have overlooked. </li>
</ol>

<p>On that note, I want to emphasize that I am INCREDIBLY impressed with how the Codeliber site has turned out! You did an amazing job and you should be very very proud of yourself! The following feedback DOES NOT detract from that in any way at all and is intended to reflect the kind of feedback that you would receive during a QA of a real development site and as a learning opportunity to increase attention to detail. Some divergences you may have been unaware of but will need to pay attention to when it comes to building a site from designs professionally:</p>


<ol>
      <li>The dimensions of the logo are inaccurate making it appear elongated in height</li>

<li>the original Codeliber site navigation menu has an underline appearance for :hover and :active item where you recreation has a background color change. That background color change goes from blue to white which makes the current :hover or :active item illegible.</li>

<li>The "Screenshot" menu item should read "Screenshots"</li>
<li>The supertitle in the hero section should read "With Codeliber, you will" instead of "with codeliber you will."</li>
<li>The subtitle in the hero section is missing spaces after the commas and "More" should not be capitalized.</li>
<li>The diagnoal white border behind the cell phone mock up has not been implemented in the hero section (this is hard and can be considered optional or a challenge to return to later).</li>
<li>The spacing around the icons in the circles in the next section down should be attended to.</li>
<li>In the three icon section on the Codeliber site, on :hover, a pink border-bottom appears. On the recreated site, the entire boxes turn pink instead.</li>
<li>The "Why Codeliber?" text should be proofread more closely.</li>
<li>In the "Main Features" section, text should be proofread more closely.</li>
<li>The icons and spinning wheel animated graphic in this section are a complex bit of layout and you did an excellent job with your attempt! I will make a note to go over this layout later so you can see how it was done. ::before and ::after are tricky and annoying but you will still run into them in older layouts so they are still important to know.</li>
<li>The "Other Amazing Features" section is supposed to be a slider - we will have to work with these as we learn JavaScript more. But you did a great job doing what you could!</li>
<li>The "Apps Screenshots" is another slider, so we will definitely go over this.</li>
<li>The "Clients Testimonial" section feels rushed here. The layout isn't quite right and there is some broken code showing as well. The divs also have very unusual names? And there is no attribution.</li>
<li>The footer "Facebook Community" reads as "facebook Community" instead and should also be a live link. The formatting under "Quick Contact" needs more attention. The Copyright section background color is white instead of a translucent black or dark grey, the "@" symbol is missing from the copyright notice, and the privacy policy is missing altogether.</li>

<p>Again, you've done an AMAZING AND INCREDIBLE JOB ESPECIALLY!!!!! if this was the first or even first dozen websites that you've built and recreated. I'm blown away!!! This is an amazing amazing job and you should be so pleased!!!! Well done!!!</p>

            <p>There should be a proper footer down here but I'm feeling IMMENSELY uncreative at the moment.</p>
