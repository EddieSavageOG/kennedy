            <h1>Firefox vs Chrome</h1>

            <h2>Why and How to use Firefox instead of Chrome</h2>

            <p>
            Alright. So the main reasons I'm suggesting Firefox for you over Chrome are: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                  <li>It's lighter on system resources</li>
                  <p>"Chrome has a reputation for hogging system resources—namely RAM, but sometimes it also hits your CPU harder than expected, too. Google has taken steps to curtail these problems, but Firefox hasn’t had the same issues with regular memory leaks. It also generally goes light on system resources. Even when you begin piling on tabs and windows, browsing sessions don’t slow down.</p>

                  <p>That said, Firefox can occasionally suffer from memory bloat as well, if you like to leave many tabs open for days. But you can quickly fix that problem by using Firefox’s Task Manager to nuke and then bring back a tab gone amok. Or, if you have the browser set to remember your browsing history, closing the app entirely and reopening it. (Your tabs should be automatically restored.) You don’t need to reboot your whole system."(<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/704687/why-quit-chrome-and-switch-to-mozilla-firefox.html" target="_new">source</a>)</p>

                  <li>Speedier website browing</li>
                  <p>"A fresh installation of Firefox automatically blocks trackers that can make browsing feel slow. The more scripts that must load as part of a website, the more you’ll feel them. Even if they’re running invisibly in the background, they’re still there. Keep them from running and your web surfing should feel much snappier.</p>

                  <p>Firefox also stops cryptominers from accessing your device, aka cryptojacking—it’s when a website allows malicious code to use your computer to mine for cryptocurrency. Indirectly, this protective feature helps with browsing speed too. If your system resources get tied up by a cryptominer accessing your device, your PC will feel sluggish, including when you’re browsing online."(<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/704687/why-quit-chrome-and-switch-to-mozilla-firefox.html" target="_new">source</a>)</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Here is some helpful tips from a Tumblr post I've saved by user @despite-everything </h2>
            <p>
            I wrote out this list of instructions/recommendations for making Firefox your default browser, and setting up some extensions I recommend. This is all my personal preference - I’m no expert, but I made these instructions for some friends and family, so I figured I’d share here, too! All the extensions are linked for convenience. </p>
            
            <p>
            1. Download <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_new">Firefox</a>, pin to dock of computer, set as default browser 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Why Firefox?</b> Mozilla is a non-profit organization, so unlike Google,  they aren’t looking to continually turn a profit, and is an open-source  project, meaning you can check the code at any time. Firefox and Safari  are independent browsers, but others like Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft  Edge all run on Chromium - meaning they’re essentially all Google. The  downside to using them is that if your entire internet access is  connected to Google, then Google is going to collect data on everything  (and then turn around and sell it all over the place).
            </p>

            <p>
            2. Add <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, set as default search engine for Firefox.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Why  DuckDuckGo?</b> Unlike Google, DuckDuckGo doesn't collect data from users,  and allows IP addresses to remain hidden/protected. Doesn’t use cookies  to track activity. Doesn’t share IP address, search terms, etc. with  sites you visit (Google, Yahoo, and Bing all share this data). I find  that the search results are more “clean” and I usually find what I’m  looking for faster, and with fewer “listicles”/bullshit SEO-filled  nonsense.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Downsides:</b> Some complex searches may not work (niche  content can be missed, but pretty much everything else is good) - so if  searching for academic sources, I recommend using Google Scholar  instead. Also uses Apple Maps instead of Google, which I don’t like as  much, but isn’t a huge problem on the desktop. I have some  privacy-centric extensions listed below, which help protect me when I do  need to turn to Google. <i>(Note from Eddie: It's not like you can't just go to Google and use it's search whenever you want, though.)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
            3. Import browser data from old browser.
            </p>
            <p>
            4. Set homepage/new tab defaults → Settings.
            </p>
            <p>
            5. Download Firefox on phone, follow instructions to sync to computer desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
            6. Install extensions! Improve internet browsing experience! Check out my list of recommendations below.
            </p>
            <p>
            7. When installing extensions, take a look at the “themes” and customize the look of your browser.
            </p>
            <p><i>Note from Eddie again: This list of extensions is from the tumblr user above. I have marked the extensions I know/use with a (*) but otherwise, I am not familiar but Firefox does a solid screening process. But still, use discernment. If unsure, don't install. I'll be back later to add my own list of extensions that I like.</i></p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            uBlock Origin (also blocks ads)(*)
            </p>
            <p>
            AdGuard Adblocker (guess what this is.)
            </p>
            <p>
            AdBlock for Firefox (I just really hate ads and want to cover my bases)
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Privacy extensions</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
            Privacy Possum (interferes with data collection by sites, helps prevent tracking)
            </p>
            <p>
            Don’t track me Google (speeds up search results, removes Google tracking feature)
            </p>
            <p>
            I still don’t care about cookies (allows cookies for sites/prevents pop ups - use with cookie auto delete for privacy)
            </p>
            <p>
            Cookie autodelete (automatically deletes cookie info from sites, pairs well with above)
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Youtube extensions</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
            Return Youtube Dislike (shows the number of dislikes on Youtube - Youtube removed this feature in 2021 for no good reason)
            </p>
            <p>
            DeRound Youtube (personal preference - makes Youtube thumbnails “sharp”. I think it looks nicer like this.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Youtube NonStop (prevents “are you still watching” prompts)
            </p>
            <p>
            SponsorBlock (removes embedded sponsor promotions within Youtube videos)

            </p>
            <p>
            Unpaywall (checks database of 16 million legal, open-access articles when you view a paywalled scholarly article to see if there’s an open version available)
            </p>
            <p>
            Don’t Accept image/webp (lets Firefox tell sites webp formats don’t work - enables easier access to downloadable jpeg/png formats on search results)
            </p>
            <p>
            Absolute Enable Right Click and Copy (some sites block the right click copy/paste option, this extension restores that ability - this seemed to interfere with my use of Google Docs so I disabled it for the site, but it may be coincidental. Need to investigate - this extension is newer to me.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Facebook Container (prevents Facebook/Meta from tracking all your web activity)
            </p>
            <p>
            LeechBlock NG (can be enabled to prevent you from using certain sites in a certain timeframe - good for productivity)
            </p>
